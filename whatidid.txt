30m Tried watching the second Angular course on code-school. It jumped into building
the app too much and even after pulling in the github repo I felt really lost. Setup basic repo for this project and learned how to pull it from both my laptop and cloud9. 


15m Looked into node js course on code school along with react offerings. Also added vue.js to my list of things to look at. Need to focus on 1 framework. 
55m Watched the first half of Douglas Crockford:The Javascript Programming Language on youtube

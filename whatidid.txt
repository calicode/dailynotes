15m Reviewed bookmarks collected recently from podcasts/meetups etc. 
120m Read 100 pages of "Eloquent Javascript" By Marijn Haverbeke. Got a bit lost on the sections regarding phi coefficients but understood the js pieces. Did all the example exercises (fizzbuzz, chess board etc).

30m Tried watching the second Angular course on code-school. It jumped into building
the app too much and even after pulling in the github repo I felt really lost. Setup basic repo for this project and learned how to pull it from both my laptop and cloud9. 


15m Looked into node js course on code school along with react offerings. Also added vue.js to my list of things to look at. Need to focus on 1 framework. 
55m Watched the first half of Douglas Crockford:The Javascript Programming Language on youtube

55m Watched the second half of Douglas Crockford:The Javascript Programming Language on youtube

60m  Code-school node.js course. 
Section 1 - setting up basic hello world server using http.createServer. 
Section 2 - Event loop basics, event emitters. Setting up multiple event listeners for one object
Section 3 - Streamd and using input.pipe(output) to simplify reads/writes. Can be used to pull data from stream to save to file. Create a simple upload script which writes a file passed to it through request and displays percentage completion.

45m(lunch)- Code-school node.js course. 
Section 4 - Modules. Learned basic exporting of modules which looks just like javascript. refrsher on package.json and npm. semantic versioning. 
Section 5 - Express. Learned about setting up basic routes and making a simple twitter request. 
105m - Code-school node.js course
Section 5 - Refactored code from video to use wikipedia api because twitter api requires auth and tying mobile phone. Setup basic template view using ejs, figured out usinbg foreach on an object won't work. I should know that. Tried setting up for in but ejs is throwing a fit. Will look at it tomorrow.

Code-school node.js course
Section 6 - socket.io. Learned how to make a basic chat server, once I saw how it worked I implemented storing nicknames and sending them to clients, still not working 100% but its ok for now. Really digging socket.io. Had a small hiccup where I listened to the wrong object server and my html would not recognize socket.io.js.

Lunch
45m - Code-School node.js course.
Section 7 - persisting data with redis. 
Not sure where redis stores the data, probably just a local file. Will look into it further. Was thinking of using indexdb or something similar with node. This might be better. 

Worked on finishing twitch streamer (http://codepen.io/calicode/pen/dMVGBE) display to play better with react. I was trying to jam all stream information into one array of objects, but could not figure out how to pass custom filters in react based on the tab selected, e.x tab = online ng-filter="stream", tab = offline ng-filter="!stream". The filter portion works if I set those values directly but changing the filter dynamically using a function or something else wasn't working. Other apps on codepen just use 3 arrays and change the $scope.streamers array based on filter. 

240m - Got to code meetup 2h early and spent the time messing with angular. Finally fixed twitch tv app, i had the same controller called twice so it was causing scope issues. just need to pretty it up a bit.
